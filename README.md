# DeliverProject

This is a demo project to demostrate `mix release` command with edeliver.
To run it, make sure you have `ssh` access to either localhost or your prefered server and execute:

```bash
mix edeliver upgrade
mix edeliver start
```

Now, a server should start at `http://localhost:8080` and you can access it to see the running application.
